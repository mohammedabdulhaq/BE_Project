This is my final year major project. this project is in the domine of VLSI region.we are using the language in verilog HDL. The title and abstract of the project is as followes
TITLE : FPGA Implementation of 32 Bit Floating Point Multiplier Using Vedic Real Multipliers
ABSTRACT : 
Floating point Complex numbers multiplication is an essential operation in DSP and communication applications with high speed and less power requirement. Hence, this paper presents an IEEE 754 format 32 x 32 bit floating point multiplier using four floating point real multipliers solution. Each 32 bit real floating multiplier requires a 24 bit fixed point real multiplier for mantissa multiplication. Based on the Indian Vedic mathematics sutra called URDHVA TIRYAKBHYAM, two architectures for 24 x24 bit Vedic real multiplier are proposed for mantissa multiplication in 32 bit floating point real multiplier. The two architectures are evaluated to choose one having less path delay for use in the propose floating point multiplier. The four floating point real multipliers solution for the proposed multiplier is coded in Verilog HDL for implementation on FPGA. Finally, the results of the proposed multiplier are compared with that of the Booth and Array multipliers.
